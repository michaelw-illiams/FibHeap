# FibHeap
CS345 Fibonacci Heap Project
This is the greater repo for the Fibonacci heap project. As we work on individual features, check out a new branch based on the master/main branch. Then merge it with main when it is completed and stable.
Make sure to merge with main and check out a new branch when creating a new feature.
