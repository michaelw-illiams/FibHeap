# CS345 Fibonacci Heap Project 
### This code works by implementing a queue using a Fibonacci Heap as it's internal implementation.  
### It is run with the main function and unit tests. 
## To Run
To run this code, clone it using the git clone feature. Then the unit tests can be ran from the test directory. If run with coverage, they will show the lines that are covered by the tests. To run the main function, go to the src directory and simply run main. It will print out the the patients in the order of the deque. Additionally it will print the root list representationm of the root nodes, this is used for comparing to the hand drawn heaps.

## To Edit 
This is the greater repo for the Fibonacci heap project. As we work on individual features, check out a new branch based on the master/main branch. Then merge it with main when it is completed and stable.  
Make sure to merge with main and check out a new branch when creating a new feature.   

## Timeline    
Week 1: investigation and early implementation of a basic structure    
Week 2: Full implementation of a priority queue using a Fibonacci heap and work on additional functions.     
Week 3: Flesh out and complete implementation of all functions and testing           
Week 4: Final testing and presentation.  
Completion: Wahoo! :grinning: <- Current Week
